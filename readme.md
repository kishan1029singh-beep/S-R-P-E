# 🚦 Smart Road AI

Smart Road AI is a research-oriented project that models traffic density
and predicts pollution levels using an AI-inspired decision system.

## Features
- Traffic-based pollution estimation
- AI solution engine
- Visualization of results
- Modular architecture

## Project Structure
- main.py → runs simulation
- pollution_model.py → pollution prediction
- solution_engine.py → AI decisions
- graph.py → visualization

## Future Scope
- Real-time sensor integration
- Machine Learning optimization
- Smart city deployment
## Note
The dataset used in this prototype is a scaled and simplified representation of real-world traffic and pollution conditions, created for modeling and algorithm validation purposes.
